    "Ans- Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented programming languages where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In Python, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes, allowing it to combine features from all of them. This can be useful for creating classes with complex behaviors that are composed of features from different sources."
